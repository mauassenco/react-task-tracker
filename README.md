## React Task Tracker

This is a React.js task tracker app that I created to demonstrate my knowledge of the React library. I used the following React concepts in this app:

* Components
* Props
* State
* Hooks
* React best practices for styling and testing

I also used the following third-party libraries:

* `react-icons` for icons
* JSON Server for a mock API

**Features**

The task tracker app has the following features:

* Add, edit, and delete tasks
* Toggle task reminders
* Filter and sort tasks
* Search for tasks
* View task details
* Dark mode

## Usage

### Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Run React dev server (http://localhost:3000)

```
npm start
```

### Run the JSON server (http://localhost:5000)

```
npm run server
```

### To build for production

```
npm run build
```


**Conclusion**

I hope this task tracker app demonstrates my knowledge of the React library. I am always learning new things about React, and I am excited to continue using my skills to build innovative and user-friendly applications.
